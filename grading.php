	 <h3>Grading criteria</h3>
     <div class="gdiv">
	   <p class="pgra">The idea of designing this web is to give the visitor a viewpoint of traveling in NYC. I choose NYC for my project topic because I live in the Manhattan where is one of the cities in NYC. Therefore, I know a lot of fun place and the good restaurant that I would like to share with people, and it might be helpful for people who want to travel to NYC in the future. In my homepage, I have designed the navigation bar with clear color and dropdowns. Each drop-down contains 3 different pages. I have 3 main content circle located on my homepage where the visitor can simply click the one they interest in, 
	   and the website will transfer to the correct page. The 3-content circle contains 3 
	   different topic information about NYC. For example, the first content circle is related to the Food. 
	   The NYC has so many restaurants and different flavor food, so I had separate the food section in 3 different parts.
	   Each part of food contains one flavor of food. In the page, I had listed out 3 different places about the
	   topic that is all recommended by myself. Also, I had the put the google map beside the restaurant which
	   will help the visitor to view the address immediately. The other 2 sessions are also the same.</p>
